# Note
The usage of scripts `hw1-q1.py` and `hw1-q2.py` remain the same as intended by the original author. However, for the sake of convenience, we've decided to add the following flag to the scripts:
```
-output <output_file_name>
```

This flag allows the user to specify the name of the output file without the extension (which varies between `.pdf` and `.png`). If the flag is not specified, the output file will be named `plot` by default.

**Also**, the output files to all the exercises in this homework are already present in the `graphs` directory. Nevertheless, the user can run the scripts to generate the output files again for verification purposes.
